## Tailwind Utilities

This module contains

1.  Tailwind's style reset in the \`globalStyles\` definition.
    Make sure to include this in your HTML via elm-css' \`Css.Global.global\` function.
2.  All default tailwind css utility classes. You can browse the documentation on
    [tailwind's website](https://tailwindcss.com/docs)

${definedNames.map(c => `@docs ${c}`).join("\n")}

-}
`,

    utilitiesGlobalStyles: () => `
{-| This contains tailwind's style reset.

This is something similar to normalize.css, if you're familiar with it.

You **need to include this in your html** at any time you use this module,
as some of the classes in here depend on css variables defined in the global styles.

You include it like so:

    import Css.Global
    import Html.Styled as Html exposing (Html)
    import Tailwind.Utilities exposing (globalStyles)

    view : Html msg
    view =
        div []
            [ -- Like this:
              Css.Global.global globalStyles

            -- Continue with any other Html
            ]

It only needs to be included once.

        }

\`\`\`css
${declaration.originalRules.map(rule => rule.toString()).join("\n\n")}

## Tailwind Breakpoints


### How tailwind's breakpoints work

Tailwind (by default) uses min-width breakpoints.

The workflow with them should be like this:

1.  You define styles for mobile without breakpoints
2.  You adjust the styling for devices _bigger than_ the \`sm\` (or \`lg\`, etc.) breakpoint
3.  You in turn override these styles with even higher breakpoints

Read more about breakpoints in the [tailwind documentation].


### A note about breakpoint usage oder

The above relies on style definitions having a certain order in css. The first style in css wins.

Thus, unfortunately **you need to be careful about the order you use your breakpoints** in elm-css.
Make sure to use breakpoints from big to small, like so:

    myElement =
        div
            [ css
                [ xxl [ text_indigo_700 ]
                , lg [ text_blue_700 ]
                , sm [ text_green_700 ]
                ]
            ]
            [ text "Colorful text"
            ]

This is _not_ the case when using tailwind directly, because then tailwind has control over the
order of declarations in the generated css, which we don't have.
